Some general information on how to survive a zombie attack is found within this [Zombie Survival Guide](./doc/ZombieSurvivalGuide.md).

To "freshen up"  your github knowledge you might want to look at: [Git Handbook · GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) - or not...

## Step 1 to a Better Life - Structuring your Repository

A file and folder structure to feel secure and find your way around:

```
[root repo folder]
  |
  + [.git] // folder - contains all infos our version system needs (do NOT delete)
  + .gitignore // always needed - content depends on programming tools/language
  + README.md // you always need that one!
  + [doc] // folder - containing detailed project documentation
  |   |
  |   + [progress_reports] // folder containing your status reports
  |                        // optional - only if you dont use "github projects"
  + [src] // folder - containg your source code
```

For`.gitignore`-creation see [gitignore.io - Create Useful .gitignore Files For Your Project (toptal.com)](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore).

## Step 2 to a Better Life - Mastering README.md

The `readme.md` is the entry-point for every  visitor to your repository (repo). It needs to contain all necessary information for the "user" to get an idea what is going on here. So add:

- a "catching" title
- what is the goal of this project (short explanation)
- who is working on this project
- a detailed explanation of the project 
- how to install/build and run the code/project
- [optional] what hardware is used/needed and how to set it up

### Information is Everything!

- A guide from github: [Documenting your projects on GitHub · GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/) (stop reading when explanation of wiki-pages starts - we don't need those)

- For additional Information (**especially concerning ITP projects at litec**)  see [Projektdokumentation auf Github](./doc/Projektdokumentation_auf_GitHub.md).  (Sadly in German, but we hope you can live with that.)
- **No idea what `md` (markdown) is? See [Mastering Markdown · GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).**

## Step 3 to ... (*you know the drill...*) - Project Management with GitHub

[Project management, made simple (github.com)](https://github.com/features/project-management)

Working together we will use:

- BRANCHES - see [Git Branch | Atlassian Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)
- Workflow [Understanding the GitHub flow · GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)    
- ISSUES - see [Mastering Issues · GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
- PULL REQUESTS 
   - Step By Step: [How to Create a Pull Request on Github: 15 Steps (with Pictures) (wikihow.com)](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Pull-Request-on-Github) 
   - Combination: [Linking a pull request to an issue - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
- *Aaaaaaand finally*:  git PROJECTS - [About project boards - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards)
